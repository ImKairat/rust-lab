### Learning Rust with Network Programming and Beyond

This repository is a personal lab for learning and experimenting with the Rust programming language.
It originally focused on TCP/IP networking protocols (transport and application layers) but is now expanding to include broader Rust topics.
Topics covered (planned & in progress):
- TCP/UDP socket programming
- Application layer protocols (HTTP, gRPC, etc.)
- Async programming in Rust
- Systems-level Rust
- CLI tools
- Error handling, traits, lifetimes, and other core Rust concepts
